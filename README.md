you'll need:

* Node : [Nodejs Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) Ideally v8.4.0 or above

* We've added an `.nvmrc` file to help with versions if you have problems. [Node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To install all the Nodejs packages, which are required, you'll need to run:

this app use argos to get the product

```
  npm install
```

In the root of the project directory.

  npm run watcher
```
